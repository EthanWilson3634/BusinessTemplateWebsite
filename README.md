# Business Template Website
# Date started 6/20/2022

I am starting this project to test my web development skills. My goal is to increase my
familiarity html, css, and javascript. The purpose of this website is to create a
creative useful and generic template website for smaller size businesses. My target audience
is Corporate Development Partners (CDP) based in Danbury Connecticut. Additionally, I
hope this project also benefits any other small business owners interested in advertising
themselves on the internet.
